html5eyeball
============

Html5 Canvas/JavaScript based semi-realistic eyeball

![Eyeball rendered with yellow iris](/screenshots/eyeball_yellow.jpg?raw=true "Eyeball example, yellow iris")

![Eyeball rendered with green iris](/screenshots/eyeball_green.jpg?raw=true "Eyeball example, green iris")

Architected from the ground up to be fully configurable. From iris colour and eyeball size to vein complexity and rotation limits.

There are over twenty user settings allowing ultra-realistic renderings to bizzare and frightening halloween visions of horror.

Sensibile defaults means nothing other than the div to render to is required.

Framework agnositic. Although jQuery is used throughout the examples is not required and just makes wiring up mouse actions easy.

I intend to write a number of blog posts on how this all came to be and once that is done I will distill the best bits into this README.md
